    // {category: 'Privacy on Incognito', ask: "Why do I need privacy for my crypto?", answer: "Information is power. If you leave your personal information public, things like your account balance, who you pay money to, where you shop, what you buy and how often, how much you get paid, etc., you're inviting the wrong sort to exercise power over you. But even if not for hackers and theft/extortion, privacy protects you in the everyday, too. Traders can protect their proprietary strategies, businesses can comply with payroll privacy laws, and you can keep your pesonal autonomy. "},
    {category: 'Privacy on Incognito', ask: "What is private on Incognito? What isn't private yet?", answer: "Currently, sending addresses and token amounts are private on Incognito. Receiving addresses and the type of currency being transacted still remain visible. With <a target='_blank' href='https://we.incognito.org/t/privacy-version-2/2967'>Privacy v2</a> implementation coming this year, receiver and type of asset will also be private, resulting in complete privacy across the board.<br><br><a target='_blank' href='https://we.incognito.org/t/the-incognito-privacy-stack-how-am-i-private/8552'>Learn what's private in every Incognito function here ></a>"},
    // {category: 'Privacy on Incognito', ask: "What is the Confidential Asset feature?", answer: "On Incognito, anyone can create an asset (token) similar to the Ethereum blockchain.

    {category: 'Privacy on Incognito', ask: "How does Ring Signature make my transactions untraceable?", answer: "Incognito uses Ring Signature to place the address initiating a transaction within a group (ring) of decoys who all sign off on the transaction. This ensures the transaction cannot be traced back to the person who initiated it.<br><br><a target='_blank' href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j3tb_W11CHAEhhRYiLsy2WefzTYM6iRJ/view?usp=sharing'>Learn more ></a>"},
    {category: 'Privacy on Incognito', ask: "How does One-time Address make my received transactions unlinkable?", answer: "A key feature of Privacy v2 will be one-time addresses: single-use proxy addresses used to anonymize the receiver in a transaction. The outputs of transactions are sent to one-time addresses not linked to the receiver's address. Only the receiver has the authority to spend from the one-time address.<br><br><a target='_blank' href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j3tb_W11CHAEhhRYiLsy2WefzTYM6iRJ/view?usp=sharing'>Learn more ></a>"},
    {category: 'Privacy on Incognito', ask: "How does Bulletproof hide my transaction amounts?", answer: "Incognito's implementation of Bulletproof allows validators to verify a transaction without actually confirming the transaction amounts, to ensure no one knows how much crypto is being sent. They do this by verifying a zero sum between the interacting addresses in the transaction instead of the actual amounts.  Rather than affirming that person A sent 1 BTC and person B received 1 BTC, validators affirm that the transaction consists of -x and +x, which equals 0. <br><br><a target='_blank' href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j3tb_W11CHAEhhRYiLsy2WefzTYM6iRJ/view?usp=sharing'>Learn more ></a>"},
    {category: 'Privacy on Incognito', ask: "How does Incognito compare to solutions like Monero and Zcash?", answer: "Monero and Zcash are single, standalone privacy coins, while Incognito is designed to enable privacy for all cryptocurrencies and applications.<br><br> We believe more privacy is always good for the industry, and that privacy should have more utility. That's why Incognito allows you to buy, sell, send, and invest your XMR and ZEC anonymously, in addition to getting privacy for your Bitcoin, Ethereum, and your other favorite currencies. <br><br><a target='_blank' href='https://we.incognito.org/t/incognito-monero-zcash-beam-and-grin/1133'>Read the technical comparison ></a>"},

    {category: 'Connecting to other blockchains', ask: 'Why does privacy need to be blockchain agnostic?', answer: "The decentralized economy is vast and diverse. Privacy coins are a great first step to protecting your privacy, but the possible use-cases of blockchain technology are endless, and you shouldn't need to sacrifice them to have privacy. A blockchain-agnostic privacy layer like Incognito allows you to use any blockchain, cryptocurrency or application anonymously. <br><br><a target='_blank' href='https://we.incognito.org/t/incognito-whitepaper-incognito-mode-for-cryptonetworks/168'>How it works ></a>"},
    {category: 'Connecting to other blockchains', ask: 'Which networks are connected to Incognito?', answer: "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Zcash, Binance, Doge, Litecoin, Dash, Neo, Zilliqa, and Tomochain have all been bridged, with more on the way."},
    {category: 'Connecting to other blockchains', ask: 'How does the trustless Ethereum bridge work?', answer: "When you send your ETH or ERC20 token to Incognito (aka “shielding”), the coins are safely stored in a trustless smart contract. That smart contract forwards instructions across the bridge to Incognito. Then, privacy coins are minted to your Incognito wallet at a 1:1 rate with the original tokens, which you can then use anonymously on Incognito.<br><br> When you want to send your pETH back to the Ethereum blockchain (“unshielding”), the pETH is burned, and instructions are sent across the bridge to the smart contract, which then releases the same amount of standard ETH to your intended recipient. <br><br> <a target='_blank' href='https://we.incognito.org/t/incognitos-trustless-bridge-v3-with-ethereum-bond-contract/2963'>Learn more about the bridge to Ethereum ></a>"},
    {category: 'Connecting to other blockchains', ask: 'Will there be trustless implementations for all bridges in the future?', answer: "Yes. Custodial bridges are an intermediary step to allow people to use their favorite cryptocurrencies anonymously without having to wait. Building trustless bridges takes time, so we prioritize the bridges with the most use and demand. The goal for the near future is that every blockchain will be trustlessly bridged to Incognito. <br><br> <a target='_blank' href='https://we.incognito.org/t/building-out-incognito-s-trustless-bridge-to-bitcoin-and-all-other-blockchains/465'>See the progress ></a><br><a target='_blank' href='https://we.incognito.org/t/need-your-help-most-wanted-bridges/7202'>Vote for the bridge you want ></a>"},
    {category: 'Connecting to other blockchains', ask: 'Can I enable privacy for an Ethereum dApp like Uniswap?', answer: "Privacy for Uniswap is already accessible through the Incognito app, as the first example of incognito mode for smart contracts.

    {category: 'Connecting to other blockchains', ask: 'What is the difference between in-network and out-network transactions?', answer: "In-network transactions are any actions that remain on the Incognito Chain for the entirety of the transaction (send/receive between Incognito addresses, trade, provide, etc). Out-network transactions are any actions that begin or end outside the Incognito blockchain (shield/unshield)."},
    {category: 'Connecting to other blockchains', ask: "What's the difference between BTC & pBTC?", answer: "pBTC = BTC on Incognito. You can always exchange 1 pBTC for 1 BTC, no matter the price, because for every 1 pBTC on Incognito, there is 1 BTC locked with a custodian which will be released to the address you choose when you unshield BTC. The same goes for all cryptocurrencies that start with the prefix 'p', which stands for \"privacy\". They are functionally the same, and appear without the prefix in the Incognito app."},

    {category: 'Troubleshooting', ask: 'Why is my transaction taking longer than usual?', answer: "For shielding/unshielding or trading on Uniswap or Kyber via pDEX, it's usually due to congestion of the external blockchain. During period of high network traffic, miners may de-prioritize your unconfirmed transaction even if it was sent with a fee appropriate for that time, causing a longer wait. <br><br>For Provide withdrawals, high volume of withdrawals can cause a longer wait.

    {category: 'Turning public coins into privacy coins', ask: 'What does it mean to shield or unshield a coin?', answer: "Shielding is how you turn your public cryptocurrencies into privacy coins by sending them to the Incognito network. <br><br>Unshielding is the reverse, sending your crypto out of the Incognito network to an external blockchain, removing privacy."},
    {category: 'Turning public coins into privacy coins', ask: 'What happens to my coins when I shield them?', answer: "When you shield your crypto, it’s locked in a trustless setup with a smart contract or by a custodian (depending on the blockchain it comes from). Then, a privacy version of that cryptocurrency is minted on Incognito to your wallet at a 1:1 rate with the original token, which you can then use anonymously.<br><br><a target='_blank' href='https://we.incognito.org/t/how-custodial-bridges-work/8600'>Get more insights of the shielding flow ></a>"},
    {category: 'Turning public coins into privacy coins', ask: 'How is my Bitcoin anonymized?', answer: "When you shield your Bitcoin, it’s sent to Incognito through the custodial bridge.

    {category: 'Turning public coins into privacy coins', ask: 'What is Ethereum gas and how does it affect fees when using Incognito?', answer: "Gas is the Ethereum network transaction fee. When shielding and unshielding ETH and ERC20 tokens, Incognito uses Ethereum smart contracts to facilitate the transfers and token custodianship. The amount of gas a transaction will require depends on how much computation is needed for a transaction, with more complex transactions (like smart contracts) requiring more. Network traffic also plays a key role in determining gas fees.<br><br>For non-ethereum-based cryptocurrencies, the respective blockchain’s fees will apply for shielding and unshielding. Incognito transaction fees are minute fractions of a PRV."},
    {category: 'Turning public coins into privacy coins', ask: 'If I shield and unshield again, is my crypto anonymized going forward?', answer: "No. Incognito is not a mixer, it's a collection of tools to help you use your crypto privately. The process of shielding and unshielding moves funds from a public blockchain to the Incognito chain and vice versa. All shield and unshield transactions are public and available on a public ledger.

    {category: 'Turning public coins into privacy coins', ask: 'Does shielding my crypto wipe its previous history?', answer: "Shielding turns on privacy mode for your crypto going forward. It does not clear your history. Shielding occurs when the Incognito chain mints new privacy assets for you on the Incognito network, which are private and untraceable.

    {category: 'Providing liquidity', ask: 'Why should I provide liquidity in the pDEX?', answer: "The more liquidity in the pDEX, the more crypto can be traded anonymously, and with less slippage. Plus, if your favorite token doesn’t have liquidity, it can’t be traded in the pDEX. When you provide liquidity, you help power privacy for the world. <br><br>Note: The current reward structure with the “Provide” feature is centralized and custodial. It’s a temporary solution as we move to a trustless liquidity incentive program soon.

    {category: 'Providing liquidity', ask: 'Where do Provide rewards come from?', answer: 'Provide rewards are drawn from a variety of sources. These include block rewards from virtual Nodes (created using some of the PRV staked in Provide), and a portion of the block rewards from pNodes that use funded staking. This model is always being optimized towards sustainability.'},
    {category: 'Providing liquidity', ask: 'Why does it take up to 3 days to withdraw from Provide?', answer: "The majority of withdrawal requests complete within a day. However, a few factors can sometimes impact the withdrawal time: amount withdrawn, total number of pending withdrawals on the network, and Node unstaking time (for PRV). To withdraw from Provide, your funds must be withdrawn from the liquidity pools, and if there is a high number of withdrawals, that may cause a delay. Sometimes, PRV that's been used to stake vNodes must be unstaked or funds will need to be shifted from other sources, which can take time as well. "},

    {category: 'Trading privately', ask: 'Why do I sometimes see Uniswap and Kyber on the pDEX screen?', answer: "Because you're trading anonymously on Uniswap and Kyber! Uniswap and Kyber were integrated with the pDEX to give you the ability to interact with them without leaving yourself exposed.<br><br>The pDEX automatically selects the best liquidity pool for any given trade – whether that's Uniswap, Kyber or pDEX. It takes into account slippage, fees, and price of course."},
    {category: 'Trading privately', ask: 'Can I select Uniswap or Kyber pools on the pDEX?', answer: "You can’t select a pool manually. The pDEX will display Uniswap, Kyber or pDEX pools based on what will get you the best rates. "},
    {category: 'Trading privately', ask: 'Why is trading on Uniswap or Kyber pools more expensive than native pDEX pools?', answer: "Trading privately with Uniswap or Kyber interacts with both the Incognito and Ethereum networks. Cross-platform trading requires multiple transactions handled concurrently (unshield, use Ethereum smart contracts, shield again, etc.) <br><br>The pDEX, however, has no trading fees, and transaction fees on Incognito are fractions of a penny.

    {category: 'Getting privacy (PRV)', ask: "Why isn't PRV listed on any exchanges or data aggregators?", answer: "We are not focused on pushing awareness of PRV, and prefer to focus on utility.

Which entities are involved?', answer: "Many parts of the Incognito source code are open-source, including the blockchain and smart contract protocols, privacy/cryptography/randomness techniques, app functions, and more. <br><br>The goal is to have the entire project's source code be open, however some parts (primarily any remaining centralized functions) are still closed for the safety of the network. Once all parts of the Incognito network have been released and audited to ensure security, the project will be entirely open-sourced."},
    {category: 'Due diligence', ask: 'Is Incognito decentralized?', answer: "Incognito is always working towards full decentralization. The goal the core team has set is for Incognito to be completely decentralized around the end of 2021. <br><br> Incognito is decentralized by design, and fully technologically decentralized. Operationally, it has a large network of nodes (2700+), but temporarily has a fixed setup where trusted nodes manage the majority of the network. Governmentally, the DAO is self-funded and runs on a community-proposal system, but decisions are manually approved by the core team for now. The goal is 100% decentralization, and soon. <br><br><a target='_blank' href='https://we.incognito.org/t/incognitos-pragmatic-approach-to-decentralization/1382'>Read more about our approach to decentralization ></a>"},
